Introduction - The Importance of Scientific Teaching and Mentoring
{{< tdclose >}}{{< tdopen >}}

We will begin by introducing ourselves and talking about what each of us hopes to get out of the class, our backgrounds and sources of interest in the subject of the seminar. We will discuss the importance of being a good teacher/mentor in the biological sciences and will read the "Scientific Teaching" article. By doing so we will set out the overall goals of the class.

We will go over the discussion class options between [7.014](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/7-014-introductory-biology-spring-2005/) or 7.02. You will be required to choose one of the two classes by Friday, two days after Ses #1 and email the instructor your decision.

Reforming Undergraduate Biology Education
{{< tdclose >}}{{< tdopen >}}

It is widely recognized that current undergraduate curricula do not adequately prepare our students for successful research careers in the biomedical sciences. The National Academy of Sciences issued a report in 2003 that called for major reform in the overall training and preparation of our students. We talk about the recommendations of the reform committee and how they may be implemented in the college classroom.

Confronting Student Misconceptions
{{< tdclose >}}{{< tdopen >}}

Whether it is our every day experience with falling objects, or our intuitive knowledge of heredity ("it's in his blood"), we all enter classroom with pre-conceived notions of the concepts at the core of the subject. Some of these pre-conceived notions are in fact misconceptions. Students who learn "over" the misconceptions tend to revert to their original, wrong, ideas after the course is over. It is increasingly becoming an accepted notion that effective teaching identifies and confronts student misconceptions.

Teaching Complex Material as a Series of Basic Concepts
{{< tdclose >}}{{< tdopen >}}

As experts, we often lose site of the fact that we only understand a complex fact because we truly understand the multiple concepts behind it. We will perform an exercise that will demonstrate just how complex biology can be and we will look at a paper that works to break-down MIT introductory biology into smaller concepts.

Multiple Intelligences
{{< tdclose >}}{{< tdopen >}}

In 1983 Howard Gardner formulated his theory of Multiple Intelligences. Since then, many books and articles have been written on the subject of MI itself and, more recently, on how it applies to the educational endeavor. Our discussion will focus on how to apply the principles of MI in the college environment, where large lecture-based courses are the norm.

Cooperative Learning
{{< tdclose >}}{{< tdopen >}}

One of the buzz words in education today cooperative or group learning. Many flavors of this type of learning exist, most with an emphasis on creating an environment where students accomplish more in a group format than any individual can accomplish by his- or herself. Some models, like the guild model discussed in today's paper, explicitly encourage the group to capitalize on each individual member's strengths to accomplish the overall goal. We will discuss applicability of various forms of group work to a number of educational environments. We will also discuss the balance between covering content and developing skills students need to acquire content on their own.

Case Studies
{{< tdclose >}}{{< tdopen >}}

Case method is a method of instruction that focuses on using real-world or made-up cases (case studies) as the main vehicle for learning. The goal is for students to learn through practice. Ideally, the cases are complex and even controversial, such that the students are engaged and motivated to explore the subject. We will discuss the use of cases as a tool, as well as the difference between pure case method and sporadic use of cases in the curriculum.

Concept Mapping
{{< tdclose >}}{{< tdopen >}}

Concept mapping is a technique that asks individual learners to plot the concepts and facts together with their interrelationships in an organizational network that is meaningful to each learner. Based on the assimilation theory of cognitive learning, concept maps have the potential to illuminate student misconceptions and to present a coherent picture of student's knowledge base. We will discuss pluses and minuses of using concept maps in the context of a large lecture course or a smaller course.

Concept-based Laboratories and Lecture Connections
{{< tdclose >}}{{< tdopen >}}

One of the recommendations defined by Bio2010 was to increase the amount of inquiry-based learning in the biological sciences. This is extremely difficult considering most students find themselves learning biology in large lecture environments with only a few hours of lab time. This week, we will look at an example of how small laboratories may be incorporated into large lecture classes to facilitate understanding and concept continuity.

Predictors of Success in College Science
{{< tdclose >}}{{< tdopen >}}

One of the most frustrating aspects of teaching is watching students who by all rights should succeed in your class fail miserably. What factors predicts student success in college level science? And what can be done to improve the chances of the students who do not come from the backgrounds likely to produce success in college science? Today's paper is focused on college level physics, but some conclusions likely transfer across the spectrum of college science.

Assessment
{{< tdclose >}}{{< tdopen >}}

With all the new techniques and theories circulating in the educational world, we need to be able to assess whether or not our pedagogical changes are having any effect on student understanding and retention. This week we will discuss how we can evaluate the effectiveness of different teaching approaches and styles to subject matter comprehension.

Student Self-assessment
{{< tdclose >}}{{< tdopen >}}

In addition to subject-matter assessment, it is often important to understand how the course affects students' self-perception. Did the student gain confidence in their ability to approach the subject matter or another related field? Are they more likely to pay attention when the subject matter of the course shows up in the media? Are they interested in applying what they learned in their everyday lives? SALG is an instrument that was developed to assess just such questions. We will discuss the instrument itself, as well as the benefits and limitations of using self-assessment.

Teaching Evolution
{{< tdclose >}}{{< tdopen >}}

Evolution is one of the fundamental subjects of modern science. It is supported by evidence from a diverse set of disciplines. And yet, somehow, the teaching of evolution in the United States remains controversial. We will discuss what it means to teach evolution to the students who graduate from American high schools.
